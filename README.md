Exercises for a course in my Masters: Advanced Computational Methods in Condensed Matter Physics 

---

### Overview

Together with [Guido Visser](https://github.com/GuidoVisser), we simulated kinetically-constrained on-lattice models to study the glass transition.

We looked at:
- The East model
- The one-spin Fredrickson-Andersen Model

on a one-dimensional chain. 

We weren't as successful as we hoped: likely because we needed to throw more computational power at longer simulations.

### Objectives
- exploring and understanding the physics of a model/problem using numerical simulations
- programming and implementation of algorithms
- working independently on a research project
- production, post-processing, analysis, and interpretation of simulation data
- presentation skills

### Contents
In this course the student can choose from a selection of advanced computational research projects in condensed matter physics, either related to the simulation of quantum many-body systems or from soft condensed matter. Each project requires writing simulation codes (various methods will be covered), generating data, post-processing and analyzing the data, and finally presenting the problem and results to the other students in a pedagogical way. This course is an extension to the courses 'Advanced Numerical Methods in Many-Body Physics' and 'Statistical Physics of Soft and Living Matter', and is an ideal preparation for larger-scope research projects (e.g. Master thesis).

### Recommended prior knowledge
- Either the course 'Advanced Numerical Methods in Many-Body Physics' or the course 'Statistical Physics of Soft and Living Matter' is recommended.
- Previous experience in programming.
